# JavaCodeCademy
This repository showcases the projects I completed as part of the Java courses I did from CodeCademy. 

I have split the projects into big and small projects depending on how much work it took to complete them. The small projects are beginner level and did not take a lot of time to complete - it was mainly to strengthen the understanding of a concept. The big projects took a bit longer and required more thinking, these were mainly end of course projects.
