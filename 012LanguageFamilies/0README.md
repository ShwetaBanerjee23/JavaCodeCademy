***Language Families:***
This program builds a model to track inherited traits across language families. This project focuses on something that often varies between language families: word order - where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

There are three files:
*Language.java*: the Language parent class, which serves as the template for all languages;
*Mayan.java*: for Mayan, a child class of Language modeled after the Mayan language family;
*SinoTibetan.java*: for SinoTibentan, a child class of Language modeled after the Sino-Tibetan language family

Concepts used: Inheritance and Polymorphism
